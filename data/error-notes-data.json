[3점]\n\nValentin Haüy not only established the first school for the blind, but also introduced the first reliable and practical system for tactile printing. However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems. Consumption behavior is also a primary object of imitation.\n* lethal: 치명적인  ** intermittent: 간헐적인  *** affiliation: 소속",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend. Such customers can be leveraged to drive word-of-mouth campaigns.\n* spurious: 겉보기만 그럴듯한  ** leverage: 활용하다",

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

He observed his town's only public park, known as Serenity Park, slowly deteriorating due to neglect. Leo's sense of duty led (a) him to take action. He gathered friends and neighbors to restore Serenity Park to its former glory.\n* deteriorate: 악화되다\n\n(B)\nLeo welcomed Jake's willingness to change with open arms. He introduced him to the group, and together, they all began to work on the park. Jake's transformation was remarkable, and he became one of the most dedicated members of the team. As the park flourished and its transformation became evident to the entire town, more people joined Leo's cause. The sense of unity and purpose was inspiring, and Serenity Park became a symbol of the power of standing up for what was right, even when it was hard — just as (b) his grandfather had always taught him.\n\n(C)\nThe park began to transform, and the sense of community that had been lost was gradually restored. However, their efforts did not go unnoticed. They faced hostility from those who had ruined the park and didn't want it to change. One day, as Leo was planting flowers, a tough-looking teenager named Jake approached (c) him. \"You think you can just come in here and change everything, huh?\" he sneered. Leo replied, \"We're just trying to make the park a better place for everyone. Why don't you join us?\" (d) He could see a glimmer of doubt in Jake's eyes as he laughed. He didn't respond and walked away.\n* glimmer: 희미한 기미\n\n(D)\nAs the park restoration project continued, Leo and his team continued to face resistance from the vandals. One evening, after another day of hard work in the park, however, Leo received an unexpected visit at his home. It was Jake. (e) He appeared uneasy but determined. \"Listen,\" Jake began, \"I've been watching you and your friends. I've seen how hard you work to make this park better. Maybe ... maybe I want to be a part of that, too. I'm tired of causing trouble, and I want to change.\"\n* vandal: 공공 기물 파손자",

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Rebecca Treiman found that first-grade pupils who had been taught using a global method tended to avoid ②using ck at the start of a word, even though they had never been taught that this was not permitted. Rather, they had learned this orthographical pattern through reading. These findings show how ③frequent exposure to written texts helps a child learn to write and spell words correctly. In the same vein, it has been found that pupils exposed to high levels of reading experiences ④to obtain higher scores in writing tasks. Also, it has been demonstrated that pupils increase their knowledge when they read, and use the information thus learned when they write. In other words, as children become more able to evaluate a text, they increase their ability to use the knowledge ⑤obtained by means of this activity in tasks related to written composition.\n* global method: 전체 단어 인식법(단어 전체나 문장을 하나의 덩어리로 인식하고 학습하는 방법)  ** orthographical: 철자법의",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend. Such customers can be leveraged to drive word-of-mouth campaigns.\n* spurious: 겉보기만 그럴듯한  ** leverage: 활용하다",

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur. ( ④ ) A key point is that our focus is not on the change in performance, but rather on the change in the state of habit that underlies performance.

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in. For example, any audible flub by the accompanist at a vocal recital (who is by my definition the music director of the recital) is sure to turn the listener's attention to the piano when it should be on the (c) singer, and the pianist's error might well throw the singer off. Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression. It is the music director's obligation to properly assimilate the music, to oversee its quality control, and to (e) connect the material with its listeners.\n* flub: 실수  ** encroach: 끼어들다",

[3점]\n\nValentin Haüy not only established the first school for the blind, but also introduced the first reliable and practical system for tactile printing. However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems. Consumption behavior is also a primary object of imitation.\n* lethal: 치명적인  ** intermittent: 간헐적인  *** affiliation: 소속",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered.

( ③ ) Like the pain telling you to remove your hand from a burning metal surface, this pain aims to force you to move somewhere safer. ( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe. ( ⑤ ) The increase in fluid production in your eyes and nose is to dilute whatever toxic molecules you were unlucky enough to breathe in, while the shortness of breath may be caused by your windpipes contracting in order to stop you from breathing in further particles.\n* aversion: 혐오감  ** trigeminal nerve: 삼차 신경  *** pungent: 강하게 자극하는",

Why do swollen rivers appear furious? Dreams and visions reinforce our tendency to imagine various purposeful entities exist. Language reinforces this, as grammar requires actors for actions — we say wind \\\"blows\\\" and sun \\\"shines.\\\" _______________ because such mistakes typically carry fewer consequences than the reverse error.

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past. To compound this illusion, space is expanding and the Earth is moving rapidly, yet we do not feel as if the space we inhabit has changed, nor do we feel as if we are moving.

The name \"myotis\" is a combination of two Greek words meaning \"mouse-eared.\" These bats are brown but also gray, depending on the time of year. In late summer, they molt their warm-toned summer fur and take on a cooler gray. These small mammals are primarily cave-dwelling bats, and to prevent predation, they live in caves with standing water. This makes them more difficult to access as a food source to larger animals, but also means their young are susceptible to drowning. To counteract this, myotis mothers give birth to twins. It takes five to six weeks before the young bats are able to fly on their own, and they become reproductively mature within their first year of life. These bats also utilize water for hunting. They are known to fly just above a body of water's surface during their nightly excursions for food.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past.

Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

This process is known as the \"formation of super-signs.\" The first step entails the automatic \"summarization\" of similar signs or organizational structures into a super-sign, in which the ①essential elements are emphasized. This means that at first glance the observer does not perceive all details. He sees, for example, only the form of a wall with the most important openings but without any details.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend. Such customers can be leveraged to drive word-of-mouth campaigns.\n* spurious: 겉보기만 그럴듯한  ** leverage: 활용하다",

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Also, it has been demonstrated that pupils increase their knowledge when they read, and use the information thus learned when they write.

One day, I was so hungry that I couldn't resist and drank the juice from his grapefruit. It tasted amazing — I even squeezed out a few extra drops. But then panic set in. The grapefruit looked dry, so I quickly poured in some water, added more sugar, and hoped for the best.

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past. To compound this illusion, space is expanding and the Earth is moving rapidly, yet we do not feel as if the space we inhabit has changed, nor do we feel as if we are moving.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

The name \"myotis\" is a combination of two Greek words meaning \"mouse-eared.\" These bats are brown but also gray, depending on the time of year. In late summer, they molt their warm-toned summer fur and take on a cooler gray. These small mammals are primarily cave-dwelling bats, and to prevent predation, they live in caves with standing water. This makes them more difficult to access as a food source to larger animals, but also means their young are susceptible to drowning. To counteract this, myotis mothers give birth to twins. It takes five to six weeks before the young bats are able to fly on their own, and they become reproductively mature within their first year of life. These bats also utilize water for hunting. They are known to fly just above a body of water's surface during their nightly excursions for food.

        "question": "31. 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?\n\nOne of the central tenets of modern psychology is that perceptual and cognitive processes arise in the brain. Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in.

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems. Consumption behavior is also a primary object of imitation.\n* lethal: 치명적인  ** intermittent: 간헐적인  *** affiliation: 소속",

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

[3점]\n\nWhen we first come to attempt some task, we have accumulated almost none of the habit.\n\nLearning is usually thought of as the relatively permanent acquired capability for performing some action. As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur. ( ④ ) A key point is that our focus is not on the change in performance, but rather on the change in the state of habit that underlies performance. ( ⑤ ) This distinction is a critical one, and it is the basis for much of the methodology in the laboratory study of learning.\n* underscore: 강조하다",

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in. For example, any audible flub by the accompanist at a vocal recital (who is by my definition the music director of the recital) is sure to turn the listener's attention to the piano when it should be on the (c) singer, and the pianist's error might well throw the singer off. Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression. It is the music director's obligation to properly assimilate the music, to oversee its quality control, and to (e) connect the material with its listeners.\n* flub: 실수  ** encroach: 끼어들다",

This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems.

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past.

For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A.

( ③ ) Like the pain telling you to remove your hand from a burning metal surface, this pain aims to force you to move somewhere safer. ( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe. ( ⑤ ) The increase in fluid production in your eyes and nose is to dilute whatever toxic molecules you were unlucky enough to breathe in, while the shortness of breath may be caused by your windpipes contracting in order to stop you from breathing in further particles.\n* aversion: 혐오감  ** trigeminal nerve: 삼차 신경  *** pungent: 강하게 자극하는",

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past.

Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred.

For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

[3점]\n\nValentin Haüy not only established the first school for the blind, but also introduced the first reliable and practical system for tactile printing. However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems. Consumption behavior is also a primary object of imitation.\n* lethal: 치명적인  ** intermittent: 간헐적인  *** affiliation: 소속",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend. Such customers can be leveraged to drive word-of-mouth campaigns.\n* spurious: 겉보기만 그럴듯한  ** leverage: 활용하다",

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred.

As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur.

Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in.

Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression.

He was known for his strong sense of justice, a value his grandfather had taught him: \"Stand up for what's right, even when it's hard.\" As Leo grew older, he became more aware of the injustices around him. He observed his town's only public park, known as Serenity Park, slowly deteriorating due to neglect. Leo's sense of duty led (a) him to take action. He gathered friends and neighbors to restore Serenity Park to its former glory.\n* deteriorate: 악화되다\n\n(B)\nLeo welcomed Jake's willingness to change with open arms. He introduced him to the group, and together, they all began to work on the park. Jake's transformation was remarkable, and he became one of the most dedicated members of the team. As the park flourished and its transformation became evident to the entire town, more people joined Leo's cause. The sense of unity and purpose was inspiring, and Serenity Park became a symbol of the power of standing up for what was right, even when it was hard — just as (b) his grandfather had always taught him.\n\n(C)\nThe park began to transform, and the sense of community that had been lost was gradually restored. However, their efforts did not go unnoticed. They faced hostility from those who had ruined the park and didn't want it to change. One day, as Leo was planting flowers, a tough-looking teenager named Jake approached (c) him. \"You think you can just come in here and change everything, huh?\" he sneered. Leo replied, \"We're just trying to make the park a better place for everyone. Why don't you join us?\" (d) He could see a glimmer of doubt in Jake's eyes as he laughed. He didn't respond and walked away.\n* glimmer: 희미한 기미\n\n(D)\nAs the park restoration project continued, Leo and his team continued to face resistance from the vandals. One evening, after another day of hard work in the park, however, Leo received an unexpected visit at his home. It was Jake. (e) He appeared uneasy but determined. \"Listen,\" Jake began, \"I've been watching you and your friends. I've seen how hard you work to make this park better. Maybe ... maybe I want to be a part of that, too. I'm tired of causing trouble, and I want to change.\"\n* vandal: 공공 기물 파손자",

This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past. To compound this illusion, space is expanding and the Earth is moving rapidly, yet we do not feel as if the space we inhabit has changed, nor do we feel as if we are moving.

The name \"myotis\" is a combination of two Greek words meaning \"mouse-eared.\" These bats are brown but also gray, depending on the time of year. In late summer, they molt their warm-toned summer fur and take on a cooler gray. These small mammals are primarily cave-dwelling bats, and to prevent predation, they live in caves with standing water. This makes them more difficult to access as a food source to larger animals, but also means their young are susceptible to drowning. To counteract this, myotis mothers give birth to twins. It takes five to six weeks before the young bats are able to fly on their own, and they become reproductively mature within their first year of life. These bats also utilize water for hunting. They are known to fly just above a body of water's surface during their nightly excursions for food.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in. For example, any audible flub by the accompanist at a vocal recital (who is by my definition the music director of the recital) is sure to turn the listener's attention to the piano when it should be on the (c) singer, and the pianist's error might well throw the singer off. Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved.

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur. ( ④ ) A key point is that our focus is not on the change in performance, but rather on the change in the state of habit that underlies performance. ( ⑤ ) This distinction is a critical one, and it is the basis for much of the methodology in the laboratory study of learning.\n* underscore: 강조하다",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

[3점]\n\nWhen we first come to attempt some task, we have accumulated almost none of the habit.\n\nLearning is usually thought of as the relatively permanent acquired capability for performing some action. As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur.

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered.

( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in.

Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression.

Our minds constantly scan for intentional actors, leading us to err when we hear mysterious sounds in darkness. What causes metal particles to move toward magnets? Why do swollen rivers appear furious? Dreams and visions reinforce our tendency to imagine various purposeful entities exist. Language reinforces this, as grammar requires actors for actions — we say wind \\\"blows\\\" and sun \\\"shines.\\\" _______________ because such mistakes typically carry fewer consequences than the reverse error.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist.

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

He was known for his strong sense of justice, a value his grandfather had taught him: \"Stand up for what's right, even when it's hard.\" As Leo grew older, he became more aware of the injustices around him. He observed his town's only public park, known as Serenity Park, slowly deteriorating due to neglect. Leo's sense of duty led (a) him to take action. He gathered friends and neighbors to restore Serenity Park to its former glory.\n* deteriorate: 악화되다\n\n(B)\nLeo welcomed Jake's willingness to change with open arms. He introduced him to the group, and together, they all began to work on the park. Jake's transformation was remarkable, and he became one of the most dedicated members of the team. As the park flourished and its transformation became evident to the entire town, more people joined Leo's cause. The sense of unity and purpose was inspiring, and Serenity Park became a symbol of the power of standing up for what was right, even when it was hard — just as (b) his grandfather had always taught him.\n\n(C)\nThe park began to transform, and the sense of community that had been lost was gradually restored. However, their efforts did not go unnoticed. They faced hostility from those who had ruined the park and didn't want it to change. One day, as Leo was planting flowers, a tough-looking teenager named Jake approached (c) him. \"You think you can just come in here and change everything, huh?\" he sneered. Leo replied, \"We're just trying to make the park a better place for everyone. Why don't you join us?\" (d) He could see a glimmer of doubt in Jake's eyes as he laughed. He didn't respond and walked away.\n* glimmer: 희미한 기미\n\n(D)\nAs the park restoration project continued, Leo and his team continued to face resistance from the vandals. One evening, after another day of hard work in the park, however, Leo received an unexpected visit at his home. It was Jake. (e) He appeared uneasy but determined. \"Listen,\" Jake began, \"I've been watching you and your friends. I've seen how hard you work to make this park better. Maybe ... maybe I want to be a part of that, too. I'm tired of causing trouble, and I want to change.\"\n* vandal: 공공 기물 파손자",

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

[3점]\n\nValentin Haüy not only established the first school for the blind, but also introduced the first reliable and practical system for tactile printing. However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past.

Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past.

Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred.

For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size.

In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A.

Our minds constantly scan for intentional actors, leading us to err when we hear mysterious sounds in darkness. What causes metal particles to move toward magnets?

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

Our minds constantly scan for intentional actors, leading us to err when we hear mysterious sounds in darkness. What causes metal particles to move toward magnets? Why do swollen rivers appear furious? Dreams and visions reinforce our tendency to imagine various purposeful entities exist. Language reinforces this, as grammar requires actors for actions — we say wind \\\"blows\\\" and sun \\\"shines.\\\" _______________ because such mistakes typically carry fewer consequences than the reverse error.

Also, it has been demonstrated that pupils increase their knowledge when they read, and use the information thus learned when they write.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems. Consumption behavior is also a primary object of imitation.\n* lethal: 치명적인  ** intermittent: 간헐적인  *** affiliation: 소속",

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains. Neurosurgeons may need to be aware of slight deviations in individual human brains — one region may be shifted a few millimeters forward or backward relative to other individuals — but by and large, this rule of brain _____________ has been upheld in modern science.\n* tenet: 신조, 주의  ** occipital lobe: 후두엽  *** cochlea: (귓속) 달팽이관",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist.

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Some of these costs are gladly paid for, whereas others are not. We begin with the very experience of time and space. The first illusion is our temporal orientation to the present. Although it may feel as if we are living in the now, the fact is that our perception lags behind real time by approximately 350 milliseconds, during which time information from the outside world is sensed, perceived, and interpreted by neural structures before being registered in conscious awareness. If we include our subsequent behavior, the estimation rises to 550 milliseconds−1 second. This means our conscious selves are actually perpetually living in the past.

This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture.

For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

[3점]\n\nValentin Haüy not only established the first school for the blind, but also introduced the first reliable and practical system for tactile printing. However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems. Millar's careful study of the functions and limitations of the sense of touch shows that the writing systems for the blind grounded on Roman symbols may have been 'pleasing to the eye', but lacked tangibility.\n* tactile: 촉지할 수 있는, 촉각의  ** legible: 읽을 수 있는  *** tangibility: 촉지 가능성(촉각으로 감지할 수 있는 실체성)",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all. It is hardly an accident that our species is the only one to engage in farming, even though a great many species eat plants.",

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in.

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all. It is hardly an accident that our species is the only one to engage in farming, even though a great many species eat plants.",

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",

However, Haüy, and most educators of the blind for many subsequent decades, believed that in the education of the blind, everything should be done to establish a bond of vital unity between the blind and the sighted. This included the writing system, which had to be legible by both the sighted and the blind, and thus systems for the blind to read and write had to follow the principles derived from visual alphabets. As was carefully studied and demonstrated by Susana Millar's work on tactile reading, such systems remained difficult for the blind to learn despite the many improvements and modified systems.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

The name \"myotis\" is a combination of two Greek words meaning \"mouse-eared.\" These bats are brown but also gray, depending on the time of year. In late summer, they molt their warm-toned summer fur and take on a cooler gray. These small mammals are primarily cave-dwelling bats, and to prevent predation, they live in caves with standing water. This makes them more difficult to access as a food source to larger animals, but also means their young are susceptible to drowning. To counteract this, myotis mothers give birth to twins. It takes five to six weeks before the young bats are able to fly on their own, and they become reproductively mature within their first year of life. These bats also utilize water for hunting. They are known to fly just above a body of water's surface during their nightly excursions for food.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A.

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur. ( ④ ) A key point is that our focus is not on the change in performance, but rather on the change in the state of habit that underlies performance. ( ⑤ ) This distinction is a critical one, and it is the basis for much of the methodology in the laboratory study of learning.\n* underscore: 강조하다",

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered. ( ② ) So not only will your brain tell you that you are at risk of being injured by whatever is giving off that horrible smell, it may also try to warn you from approaching it by making you experience physical pain. ( ③ ) Like the pain telling you to remove your hand from a burning metal surface, this pain aims to force you to move somewhere safer. ( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe. ( ⑤ ) The increase in fluid production in your eyes and nose is to dilute whatever toxic molecules you were unlucky enough to breathe in, while the shortness of breath may be caused by your windpipes contracting in order to stop you from breathing in further particles.\n* aversion: 혐오감  ** trigeminal nerve: 삼차 신경  *** pungent: 강하게 자극하는",

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in. For example, any audible flub by the accompanist at a vocal recital (who is by my definition the music director of the recital) is sure to turn the listener's attention to the piano when it should be on the (c) singer, and the pianist's error might well throw the singer off. Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression.

He was known for his strong sense of justice, a value his grandfather had taught him: \"Stand up for what's right, even when it's hard.\" As Leo grew older, he became more aware of the injustices around him. He observed his town's only public park, known as Serenity Park, slowly deteriorating due to neglect. Leo's sense of duty led (a) him to take action. He gathered friends and neighbors to restore Serenity Park to its former glory.\n* deteriorate: 악화되다\n\n(B)\nLeo welcomed Jake's willingness to change with open arms. He introduced him to the group, and together, they all began to work on the park. Jake's transformation was remarkable, and he became one of the most dedicated members of the team. As the park flourished and its transformation became evident to the entire town, more people joined Leo's cause. The sense of unity and purpose was inspiring, and Serenity Park became a symbol of the power of standing up for what was right, even when it was hard — just as (b) his grandfather had always taught him.\n\n(C)\nThe park began to transform, and the sense of community that had been lost was gradually restored. However, their efforts did not go unnoticed. They faced hostility from those who had ruined the park and didn't want it to change. One day, as Leo was planting flowers, a tough-looking teenager named Jake approached (c) him. \"You think you can just come in here and change everything, huh?\" he sneered. Leo replied, \"We're just trying to make the park a better place for everyone. Why don't you join us?\" (d) He could see a glimmer of doubt in Jake's eyes as he laughed. He didn't respond and walked away.\n* glimmer: 희미한 기미\n\n(D)\nAs the park restoration project continued, Leo and his team continued to face resistance from the vandals. One evening, after another day of hard work in the park, however, Leo received an unexpected visit at his home. It was Jake. (e) He appeared uneasy but determined. \"Listen,\" Jake began, \"I've been watching you and your friends. I've seen how hard you work to make this park better. Maybe ... maybe I want to be a part of that, too. I'm tired of causing trouble, and I want to change.\"\n* vandal: 공공 기물 파손자",

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

As such, experimenters often think of learning as a kind of \"accumulated quantity.\" ( ① ) Many years ago, the state underlying performance was termed \"habit,\" where we would say that practice \"strengthens habit,\" and \"stronger habit\" allows more effective performance to occur. ( ② ) Of course, this says nothing about what habit is, but it does underscore the idea that we are attempting to study those principles that govern the accumulation of habit with practice. ( ③ ) Then, with additional practice, habit is thought to build in strength, and it is this stronger (in some sense) habit that allows improved performance to occur. ( ④ ) A key point is that our focus is not on the change in performance, but rather on the change in the state of habit that underlies performance.

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered.

( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe.

It is also the expectation, conscious or not, of colleagues and audiences alike. Imperfection results in (a) visibility; people generally do not notice the workings of the music until they go wrong. Writers and directors (b) support absolute musical proficiency because fluency ensures maximum believability and comprehension. The better a language is spoken, the more communicative and emotional power it has. If stage music is supposed to appear from nowhere, it certainly should not trip and fall on its way in. For example, any audible flub by the accompanist at a vocal recital (who is by my definition the music director of the recital) is sure to turn the listener's attention to the piano when it should be on the (c) singer, and the pianist's error might well throw the singer off. Take another example: if an excessively loud music cue is suddenly heard in the midst of a quiet, tender dramatic moment of a play (or film), the intent of the drama will be (d) preserved. When music does encroach on a dramatic or entertainment setting on a stage, it should sound as if it belonged there, it should sound musically right, and it should leave a good impression. It is the music director's obligation to properly assimilate the music, to oversee its quality control, and to (e) connect the material with its listeners.\n* flub: 실수  ** encroach: 끼어들다",

Our minds constantly scan for intentional actors, leading us to err when we hear mysterious sounds in darkness. What causes metal particles to move toward magnets? Why do swollen rivers appear furious? Dreams and visions reinforce our tendency to imagine various purposeful entities exist. Language reinforces this, as grammar requires actors for actions — we say wind \\\"blows\\\" and sun \\\"shines.\\\" _______________ because such mistakes typically carry fewer consequences than the reverse error.

In 2015, fewer than 20% of children aged 8 to 10 owned a smartphone, and the ownership rate gradually increased with age, continuing to rise steadily through age 18. In 2021, 31% of 8-year-olds and 32% of 9-year-olds had smartphones — more than double the rates recorded for the same age groups in 2015. In 2021, the sharpest increase in ownership occurred between ages 11 and 12, whereas in 2015, the largest jump was between ages 10 and 11. In each age group of 14- to 18-year-olds in 2021, over 90% owned smartphones, with 17-year-olds showing the highest rate, at 97%. Additionally, in 2021, more than two thirds of 12- and 13-year-olds had smartphones, and from age 14 onward, ownership rates fluctuated rather than continued to rise steadily with age.\n* fluctuate: 오르내리다",

        "question": "26. southeastern myotis에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?\n\nThe southeastern myotis is a species of bat native to the southeastern United States. The name \"myotis\" is a combination of two Greek words meaning \"mouse-eared.\" These bats are brown but also gray, depending on the time of year. In late summer, they molt their warm-toned summer fur and take on a cooler gray. These small mammals are primarily cave-dwelling bats, and to prevent predation, they live in caves with standing water. This makes them more difficult to access as a food source to larger animals, but also means their young are susceptible to drowning. To counteract this, myotis mothers give birth to twins. It takes five to six weeks before the young bats are able to fly on their own, and they become reproductively mature within their first year of life. These bats also utilize water for hunting. They are known to fly just above a body of water's surface during their nightly excursions for food. They eat a wide variety of prey, and they consume up to a third of their body weight in insects per night!\n* molt: (깃·털·허물 등을) 벗다  ** excursion: 나들이",

By virtue of language and meaning, you can think about possible future events, about people who are far away, about promises made in the distant past. A rat or insect essentially lives in the immediate present and can respond only on the basis of what it can see, hear, and taste. Language allows people to see the present through the lens of those other, invisible facts and even to imagine possible events that have never occurred. This facility is powerfully helpful and liberating. As just one example, animals that have no language cannot possibly understand that some of this year's harvest has to be saved for planting next year, and they might eat their seed corn when they get hungry. They would feel better in the short run, but next year they would have nothing to plant and hence no crop at all.

[3점]\n\nIn his study of cooperative foraging among the Inujjuamiut, Eric Alden Smith found that the composition of foraging groups often conformed to predictions. For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size. Together, these two studies support the prediction that _______________________.\n* foraging: 수렵 채집  ** solitary: 단독의  *** ptarmigan: 들꿩",

In such a case, knowing less about each city might actually improve the judgment if the degree of recognition was all that was available to differentiate the options. In fact, nearly all Germans correctly judged that San Diego is the larger city.\n\n(B) Conversely, Americans show greater expertise than Germans about the relative size of cities in Germany.

For example, the trigeminal nerve can be triggered by irritant particles. ( ① ) This nerve stretches across your face and can send strong signals of pain when triggered. ( ② ) So not only will your brain tell you that you are at risk of being injured by whatever is giving off that horrible smell, it may also try to warn you from approaching it by making you experience physical pain. ( ③ ) Like the pain telling you to remove your hand from a burning metal surface, this pain aims to force you to move somewhere safer. ( ④ ) For instance, being exposed to a pungent smell might cause your eyes to tear and your nose to run, which may make it harder for you to breathe. ( ⑤ ) The increase in fluid production in your eyes and nose is to dilute whatever toxic molecules you were unlucky enough to breathe in, while the shortness of breath may be caused by your windpipes contracting in order to stop you from breathing in further particles.\n* aversion: 혐오감  ** trigeminal nerve: 삼차 신경  *** pungent: 강하게 자극하는",

Why do swollen rivers appear furious? Dreams and visions reinforce our tendency to imagine various purposeful entities exist. Language reinforces this, as grammar requires actors for actions — we say wind \\\"blows\\\" and sun \\\"shines.\\\" _______________ because such mistakes typically carry fewer consequences than the reverse error.

Throughout history, many laws have turned out to be an ethical disgrace when viewed with hindsight. Slavery is just one example of a situation that was legal, but that subsequently was declared immoral. Child labour is another. There are also laws and regulations that one has to break in certain situations if one is to act ethically. Jumping a red light or crossing a solid double line on the road may be the correct decision if it means getting a critically ill child to hospital sooner, and thereby increasing the chances of saving the child's life. Law and ethics are related, but they are not necessarily correlated or causally related. We must be cautious both when technology is changing and about allowing the law to take precedence over ethics. Particularly in the case of new technology, for example, technological singularity, a legal basis does not yet exist. In such cases, one must resort to the legal philosophy of the exception and the limitations of the law on the one hand, and ethical reflections on the other hand.\n* disgrace: 수치  ** hindsight: 뒤늦은 깨달음  *** singularity: 특이점",

It is, rather, an evolved adaptive mechanism to the ancestral reality that 'falling behind one's local rivals can be lethal'. When food supplies are intermittent because of wars or acts of nature, class affiliation is frequently the difference between survival and starvation. The law of natural selection is to blame for why people do not suffer the loss of status well, and will sometimes (if not frequently) resort to extreme measures to avoid it. The key point is that effective behavioral expressions of instinctive drives are culture- or context-specific. The immediate source of status could be hunting skill, age, number of wives or children, college admission scores, the make of a pickup truck, or the label on a woman's handbag. The purchase, use, and display of goods is the predominant means by which people seek to communicate their position to others in mature capitalist systems.

A shopper who has been purchasing a brand regularly for ten years would be considered more loyal than one who has been doing so for four years. However, relying on behavioral data alone is inadequate because it might only measure spurious loyalty, behavior that resembles brand loyalty but is not genuine loyalty caused by both true brand preference and regular buying. Rather, it is merely repeat purchase behavior (behavioral brand loyalty), buying a brand repeatedly due to factors such as indifference, convenience, low price, or unavailability of the preferred brand (versus brand preference). Consequently, in addition to behavioral data, marketers should also collect attitudinal or preference data such as measures of customer satisfaction, intent to repurchase, and brand advocacy, a measure of attitudinal loyalty that entails planning to recommend or recommending the brand to others. Brand advocacy can be measured simply by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a specific brand to a friend.

Even if these processes are about objects in the world and perceived through sensory organs, the brain's role is still considered central. Implicit in this view is that all human brains are organized in similar ways. This turns out to be supported over and over again. For example, regardless of gender, age, ethnic background, racial identification, native language, and any other feature that distinguishes one human from another, brain regions serve the same functions across these distinctions. For example, the occipital lobe processes visual information for all sighted persons (indeed, all sighted mammals). Wernicke's area and Broca's area are language areas in all human brains. The primary auditory cortex processes input from the cochlea in all human brains.

For example, when one group is captured and transported to another culture, the captured individuals have no say in how they will be treated or what behaviors they will be forced to practice. Often, as a matter of survival, they must learn some of the captors' language and behaviors; their original cultural dress may be removed and they may be given dress from the culture that captured them. This was often the practice with the capture of individuals to serve as slaves within the US culture. However, US slave records have suggested that, even with the provision of elements of dress from the enslaving culture, the enslaved found ways to modify dress to present and preserve their own cultural aesthetics, as in tying a headscarf to approximate a \"wrapper\" from their West African roots.

For hunt types in which the highest per capita returns were achieved via solitary hunting, such as ptarmigan hunting, cooperative groups were rare. For other hunt types, however, there was frequently a mismatch between the observed group sizes and the seemingly optimal group size. When hunting beluga whales, for instance, per capita returns declined when group sizes exceeded 6 hunters, but the average group size was 10.7 individuals. In an analogous study of foraging in the Indonesian community of Lamalera, Michael Alvard and David A. Nolin determined that cooperative whaling provides higher per capita returns than other foraging activities. When whaling crews do not detect whales and resort to pursuits of other species, the per capita returns decline substantially as a function of crew size.

This motivation may arise from a temporary goal (e.g., to hire the best person for a position) or to consistently avoid prejudiced responses (e.g., to be an egalitarian person). These differing motivations to be accurate both contribute to reducing the application of activated stereotypes. In a study showing the former, participants who were told that they would have to share and explain their judgments of members of occupational groups showed lower use of stereotypes compared with participants whose judgments remained anonymous. Interestingly, participants who had to explain their ratings but in whom a cognitive load had been imposed showed higher levels of stereotyping. This result indicates that avoiding the use of stereotypes in judgment can be effortful, requiring cognitive resources. An example of the latter motivation is a study on the suppression of stereotypes. When people are instructed to avoid using stereotypes to judge others, they can succeed in doing so. When they are under a cognitive load or no longer feel that they need to inhibit their stereotypes, however, judgments are colored by stereotypical associations.\n* egalitarian: 평등주의의  ** anonymous: 익명인\n\nPeople who are motivated to judge others ___(A)___ can reduce reliance on stereotypes, but they are more likely to fall back on habitual biases when ___(B)___ cognitive strain.",
